          <p>Hey there! Welcome to my website. Check out my design work using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
          <p>As a professional in learning and development, I am passionate about collaborating with coworkers, clients, and leadership to create engaging and effective learning experiences. I believe that learning should be fun, creative, and impactful. To achieve this, I work closely with my teammates to develop content that is easy to understand and apply.</p>
           <p>I enjoy researching and designing learning experiences that actively involve learners in their own learning journey. I believe that by making learning engaging and enjoyable, learners are more likely to retain the information and apply it in their daily lives.</p>
           <p>Over the course of my 17-year career in learning and development, I have developed expertise in instructional design, facilitation, project management, and leadership. These skills have helped me to create successful learning experiences that meet the needs of learners and organizations alike.</p>

            <div class="panel">
              <p>As an instructional designer, I have developed content using different software programs to produce learning materials in various formats. These materials are designed to meet learners' needs, allowing them to comprehend and retain information, resulting in improved KPIs.</p>

              <div class="panel">
              <p>I motivate and push each student in my classroom to strive for their best. I work closely with the client and leadership to pinpoint areas of growth and incorporate real-life scenarios into training. I encourage my learners to actively participate and apply their newfound skills and knowledge by facilitating both face-to-face and virtual sessions.</p>
              </div>
              <button class="accordion">Project Management</button>
              <div class="panel">
              <p>In the past three years, I have expanded my skillset to include leading, project managing, and collaborating with other designers. I use Design Thinking and Agile Methodology to develop storyboards for simulations, create videos, create content, and provide the best learning solutions/products.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Leadership</button>
                <div class="panel">
              <p>As a Lead Instructional Designer, I follow an organized and detail-oriented approach that not only supports my team but also fosters their development. I am consistently available to provide assistance, ensuring that they understand the overall learning strategy, timelines, individual assignments, and available resources. Through my daily interactions with the team, I have built a strong trust, guiding them to create impactful learning. Additionally, I lead collaborative learning sessions that enhance their skills in new tools, lines of business, processes, and procedures. This has not only improved their performance but also ensured the timely completion of projects.</p>

                <p>Throughout my professional journey, I have acquired a diverse skillset that allows me to competently perform the roles of Instructional Designer, Project Manager, and Lead Instructional Designer simultaneously. By leveraging this unique skillset, I am able to manage multiple large-scale projects efficiently while also designing and developing content when required. Regardless of the role I am performing, my top priority is always the learner, and I ensure that the training I create is centered around their needs and guarantees their success.
